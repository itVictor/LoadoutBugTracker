# What is this?
`LoadoutBugTracker` is the public-facing bug tracker for Red Sun Over Paradise's plugins, [forum](https://forum.redsun.tf) and [main website, the Red Sun Loadout](https://redsun.tf).

## Why are we using GitHub and not the forums?
It gives us access to better notifications, ability to tag issues, assigning specific developers to bugs based on their speciality and an overall more sophisticated system than just using a forum board that is not used as much in the first place.

## Public repositories
We also have few gamemode plugins open source. If you want to suggest or report bugs related to one of gamemode, should be done in said repository instead of here
- [Super Zombie Fortress](https://github.com/redsunservers/SuperZombieFortress)
- [Versus Saxton Hale](https://github.com/redsunservers/VSH-Rewrite)
