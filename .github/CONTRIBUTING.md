# Contribution Guidelines

Please consider the following guidelines when reporting an issue.

#### Not for general support
This is not the right place to get help or report players, please use our [forum](https://forum.redsun.tf/) instead.

### How should I submit Issues?
Be sure to describe clearly what the bug is and what you have possibly done to trigger said bug. Trying to include the following stuff will make your submitted issue easier to be fixed:
* **If it happened inside our server(s)**, map and server where the bug happened on.
* Steps to recreate the bug, if applicable.
* Any errors printed from the platform (In-game console, web page, etc.)

#### Issues with security implications
Please report any security bugs to administrators rather than to this public issue tracker.

#### We're only human
Please keep in mind that we maintain the servers in our spare time, at no cost. There is no SLA, and you are not owed a response or fix.
